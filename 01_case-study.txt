Specific Problem Mentioned
* Unresolved Bugs
* Testing Process
* Several Tasks

The general problem: several tasks are still in progress and it is apparent to cause delay. 

The possible circumstances inside the company: 
* Communication and Collaboration Issue
*  Resource Constraints
* Inadequate planning


As a software engineer, it is his duty to take care of his staff or subordinates, 
to maintain the plan or carry out a project safely, so that it can be fulfilled in the stipulated time. 
Possible factors that cause a project to be delayed are communication issues, resource constraints, inadequate planning. 
Because of these, there is a problem because communication is important in doing the project 
so that we know what is being completed in the daily tasks given, and also one of the reasons is the lack of people, 
and the equipment, because if there is no lack of personnel and equipment a project can easily be completed 
because there are enough personnel and equipment to do it. 
And what is important to everyone is to give the right plan of what they should do 
because without a proper plan a project cannot be worked properly and those who will do it should be given a task 
so that they can focus on their task must be finished.


If I am in this situation, my suggestion is that the project to be done should be detailed 
so that the staff knows their goal and what they should do, and there should always be communication with each other 
so that the software engineer knows the occurs in what he asks the staff he has to do 
and one of the things that should not be lost is the resource constraint 
because when doing a project there must be enough budget and staff to work for the set time that is set to finish 
so if the budget is not enough, a project that is being done can really be delayed because with a software engineer 
it has a beginning and an end when it will be finished, so the personnel and equipment needed to do this project should be 
sufficient, because a project cannot be delayed when the complete materials used in making a project.
