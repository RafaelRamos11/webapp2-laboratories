/*
An annoying characteristic of a person is that they are arrogant,
because it is not a good thing for their personality
and they don't listen to the opinions of others
because they are always the only ones who are right,
other people lose their sense and are ashamed to express their ideas,
so it is difficult to live with an arrogant person
and think highly of themselves, so stay humble.
